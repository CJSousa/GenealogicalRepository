This project was developed for the university course LAP (Linguagens e Ambientes de Programação).

" Genealogical repositories are data structures that register relationships between several generations of individuals.

Those repositories can be used to register historical information about human families and communities, but also as a genetic tool for the development of breeds of animals and plants.

Here, we restrict ourselves to biological sexual reproduction, ignoring other aspects like, for example, adoption.

The aim of this project is to write a closed OCaml module named "Genealogy" containing a data representations for genealogical information."
